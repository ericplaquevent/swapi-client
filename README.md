# SWAPI React Client
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then I installed the following packages to play around with GraphQL :

- apollo-client
- react-apollo
- apollo-cache-inmemory
- apollo-link-http
- graphql
- graphql-tag

(no need to run it it's already done)
```bash
 npm install --save apollo-client react-apollo apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http graphql graphql-tag
```

## Start client

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


## Install server

Clone the repo :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql.git
```

Set the server port in package.json :

```json
"start": "PORT=9999 node lib/server/main.js",
```

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
